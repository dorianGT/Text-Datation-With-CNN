# Text Dating with CNN

## Description:
This project, supervised by N. Vincent and B. Bohet in collaboration with the THALIM laboratory (UMR7172) at Sorbonne Nouvelle University, aims to estimate the date of composition of a text using computational methods. We will employ deep convolutional networks in Python to analyze textual data as time-series, respecting the sequential order of words. By training the model on sufficient data, we aim to classify texts into different time periods. Key stages include text encoding, network implementation, and parameter optimization.
